# this file maps Visual Pinball (VP) ROM names to pyprocgame 
#  games and yamls
# NOTE: the location of this file is specified in the
# config.yaml file (located in your username/.pyprocgame/)
# or a config.yaml file in the working directory where the
# game is launched.  A config file found in the current 
# working directory stops the search, and thus takes 
# precidence over any config file in the user's directory!
#
# the relevant setting in the config file is:
#   vp_game_map_file: /path-to-file/filename.yaml
# for example, mine is, 
#   vp_game_map_file: /P-ROC/shared/vp_game_map.yaml


# Path to your pyprocgame directory
rundir: C:\P-ROC\

# Create an entry for each pinmame ROM associated with the VP table you want to use.

    # this value MUST start with a slash...weird no?
